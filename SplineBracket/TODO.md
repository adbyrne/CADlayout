# SplineBracket TODO

## Project Status: Complete (v1.0.1)

Test prints successful. Both parts fit and assemble correctly.

### Completed
- [x] Holder geometry: outer block, trapezoid groove, bolt hole, V-tongue
- [x] Bracket geometry: L-shape, dual full-height gusset ribs, V-groove, bolt holes, 3mm inside fillets
- [x] Export STLs for both parts
- [x] Parametric generation script (`scripts/generate_splinebracket.py`)
- [x] PrusaSlicer successful, test print #1 (v1.0, 220mm leg — leg height typo)
- [x] Corrected bracket leg height 220→120mm, lower bolt hole Y=-193→Y=-93
- [x] Re-sliced and printed (v1.0.1, 120mm leg)
- [x] Test prints successful — project complete

### Future Considerations
- [ ] Bracket print orientation guidance (document preferred orientation)
- [ ] Consider a second horizontal bolt hole in the vertical leg for extra security
- [ ] Parametric variant for different spline widths (currently 40mm groove bottom)
